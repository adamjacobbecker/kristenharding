  <p>I am a writer, director, and editor living Brooklyn, New York. As a recent graduate of NYUâ€™s Tisch School of the Arts, I have had the opportunity to write and direct several of my own films while simulateously gaining invaluable experience on both feature films and telvevision shows. My passion lies in artistic expression via the sharing of compelling stories, and my work often combines naturalism and surrealism to create a new, unique outlook.</p>

  <p>I am a light-hearted, passionate, hardworking filmmaker looking to harness my skills, share my point of view, and continue to work, learn, and grow as a young professional and creative individual.</p>
