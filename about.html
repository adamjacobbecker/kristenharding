  <img src="/img/kristen.jpg" class="kristen" />
  <p>I am a writer, director, and editor living in Brooklyn, New York. 
  <br><br>
  As a graduate of NYUâ€™s Tisch School of the Arts, I have had the opportunity to write and direct several of my own 
  <br>films while simulateously gaining invaluable experience on both feature films and television shows. My passion lies 
  <br>in artistic expression via the sharing of compelling stories, and my work often combines naturalism and surrealism 
  <br>to create a new, unique outlook.</p>

  <p>I am a light-hearted, passionate, hardworking filmmaker looking to utilize my skills, share my point of view, and
  <br>continue to grow as a young professional and creative individual.</p>
