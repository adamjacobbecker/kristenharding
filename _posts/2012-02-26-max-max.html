  When Max moves to the Big Apple, he doesn't have a clue in the world. Girls, the city...none of it seems to make sense. 
  Little does Max know that he's about to embark on one of the most eye-opening journeys that he's ever taken, when a dog 
  that was supposed to simply cure his boredom winds up teaching him a whole lot more than he expected about life, the big 
  city, and everything in between.
