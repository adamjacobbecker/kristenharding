  At the age of 50, Frank Grillo might be a veteran to the acting business, but now he’s getting ready to take things to another level. 
  This summer alone, Grillo takes on the role of Crossbones in May’s Captain America: Civil War, followed by the return of his hit show, 
  Kingdom, on DirecTV in June. And come July, Grillo will grace the big screen in The Purge: Election Year.
